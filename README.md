nStateFlags
=========

Application that shows the state flags for the TI-NSpire calculator

About:
This program contains the flags for all 50 states of The United States as well as the capital, land area and population.  It works on the TI-NSpire CX with ndless 3.1 and higher.

How to put on calculator:
Start up TI-NSpire Student Software or whatever you use to put it on the calculator.  Then just drag-n-srop the nStateFlags-sdl.tns file into the application to transfer it to your calculator.  You have to have ndless 3.1 or higher on your calculator in order to run it

How to use:
Use the arrow keys or the 2,4,6,8 keys for convenience to navigate around the list of states/flags.  Then use the Ctrl or Enter key to bring up details about a particular state.  From there you see the land area, population and capital as well as a larger image of the state's flag.

Press Esc to go back to the list of states/flags.

Press Esc from this list of states/flags to close out of the program.
